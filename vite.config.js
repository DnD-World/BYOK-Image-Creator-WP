       * Two providers will not talk to a browser, so their requests go through

       * Cloudflare sends no CORS headers at all — verified 2026-09-02, even an
       * unauthenticated request throws "Failed to fetch" before it leaves the
       * page.
       *
       * NVIDIA answers the preflight 200 but with no Access-Control-Allow-Origin
       * header, which a browser reads as a refusal — verified 4 September 2026.
       * That is what "the NVIDIA account failed to fetch" was: not the key, not
       * the address, and nothing a page can work around.
       *
       * Everything else we talk to (Google, OpenAI, Mistral, OpenRouter,
       * Pollinations) sends the header and is called directly. Checked, not
       * assumed.
