/**
 * The dark the app sits on, tinted by whichever accent you picked.
 *
 * The six surface tones used to be fixed warm browns — #17120e and friends —
 * hand-picked to sit under the ember accent. That meant changing the accent to
 * Glacier gave you a cold blue button on a warm brown page: the highlight
 * moved and the room it was in did not.
 *
 * These are now derived from the accent's own hue. The saturation and
 * lightness curve is taken from the original brown set, so ember comes out
 * within a shade of where it always was and every other accent gets the same
 * treatment in its own colour — dark blood red for Dragonfire, dark sea blue
 * for Glacier, near-black purple for Potion.
 *
 * Only surfaces. Text stays the warm off-white it was: tinting the text as
 * well drops contrast at exactly the point where it matters, and a page can
 * be moody without being hard to read.
