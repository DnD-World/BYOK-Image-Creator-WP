/**
 * Bytes that make a file parse differently on someone else's machine.
 *
 * This exists because of a real failure. The v1.0.0 release build died on a
 * fresh Windows checkout with "SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token",
 * while the same commit passed on the author's own Windows machine and in
 * Linux CI.
 *
 * The cause was the shebang. `scripts/mcp-server.js` starts with
 * `#!/usr/bin/env node`, and Git checks source out as CRLF on Windows unless
 * told otherwise. Vitest strips the shebang up to the newline and leaves the
 * carriage return behind, which lands in front of the first statement as a
 * stray token. Node itself parses the same file happily, and so does esbuild,
 * which is why it survived every check until a release actually ran.
 *
 * The fix is .gitattributes pinning line endings to LF. These tests guard the
 * things that make it come back:
 *
 *   · a file starting with a shebang must not have CRLF endings
 *   · invisible characters must be written as escapes, so they cannot be
 *     silently lost, transformed, or mistaken for whitespace
